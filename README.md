# Coeus
This is a service that will visit different websites through a chromedriver to match and
compare prices. It will then send these prices to the main site where we will distribute
the prices to users who opt in to certain items.

## How to use it
Run `php artisan chrome-driver:start` to start the chrome driver.
Visit local host to run the driver. This will change in the future.

# Project Name
Coeus means questioning, while the respective Roman deity was Polus, the celestial axis around which the heavens revolve. 
Based on his Greek name, it has been suggested that Coeus may have also been the Titan of inquisitive minds and intellect.
